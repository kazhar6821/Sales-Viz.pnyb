#Sales Data Visualization Project
#Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data from the provided dataset (Sales (2).csv). The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data through advanced data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization techniques. Using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly, this project generates a variety of charts, graphs, and maps to represent global sales trends, regional performance, product categories, and more.

Whether you're a data analyst, business stakeholder, or developer, this project provides tools and visualizations to better understand sales patterns and make data-driven decisions.

#Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing :
Handles missing values using median imputation for numeric columns and mode imputation for categorical columns.
Converts non-numeric values to appropriate numeric types.
Adds new features such as ProfitMargin and normalized numeric columns for better analysis.
#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
Generates summary statistics for numeric columns.
Visualizes distributions of key metrics like revenue, profit, and units sold using histograms and KDE plots.
Analyzes correlations between numeric features with a heatmap.
#Advanced Visualizations :
Bar Charts : Total revenue by region, profit distribution by sales channel.
Pie Charts : Revenue contribution by sales channel.
Line Charts : Monthly revenue trends over time.
Boxplots : Revenue distribution across different sales channels.
Pairplots : Relationships between numeric features.
World Map : Interactive geographical map showing global sales distribution by country, with bubble sizes representing units sold and color intensity reflecting total revenue.
Interactive and Dynamic Elements :
Uses plotly for interactive charts and maps, allowing users to hover over data points for detailed insights.
Includes animations and filters to enhance user experience.
#Scalability :
Designed to handle large datasets with minimal modifications.
Modular code structure makes it easy to extend or adapt for other datasets.
